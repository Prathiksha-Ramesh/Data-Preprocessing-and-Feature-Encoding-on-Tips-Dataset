# Project Title: Data Preprocessing and Feature Encoding on Tips Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of loading the `tips` dataset, performing data preprocessing, encoding categorical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The goal is to provide a comprehensive example of how to prepare data for machine learning tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

The required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file:

- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Usage
1. Data Preparation: The notebook loads the tips dataset using seaborn.

2. Running the Notebook: Open the notebook.ipynb file to follow the step-by-step process.

## Steps in the Notebook:
1. Import Libraries:

Import necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. Load Dataset:

Load the tips dataset using seaborn.
3. Explore Data:

Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Check the dataset's information and value counts of categorical features.
4. Prepare Data:

Separate the dataset into independent and dependent features.
5. Split Data:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
6. Feature Encoding:

Encode categorical features using `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder`.
Apply column transformations to ensure all categorical features are properly encoded.
